Testing Jekyll on Github Pages.

The setup has been rather easy because I'm on Windows. It looks like it would have been *really* easy if I used a Mac or Linux. The more I try webdev things on Windows, the more I feel like a Mac is the best fit. It would have been easier also if I weren't sticking to Python3. I met the following difficulties:

- easy_install would not install Pygments on my computer. Using setup.py worked like a charm.
- ruby_devkit is a little trickier to install on windows
- Jekyll doesn't support Python3. `set PATH=C:/Python27;%PATH%` did the trick.
